*This is a same that allows you to check remote information against a stable server*
## HOW DOES IT WORK
Basically it's just an app that shows IP details based on your URL/params that you send to the server. So far, it tracks the IP of whoever visits it and creates logs of it.

Nothing to it.
## WHAT IS GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED
- IP address visibility and information
- GeoLocation system
- speedtestin and line testing.
